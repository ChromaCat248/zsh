# zshrc
My ZSH config

Clone repo into `~/.config/`, then you can either symlink `.zshrc` into your home folder or set `ZDOTDIR=~/.config/zsh`.

The fancy ls alias in `./zshrc.d/aliases.zsh` relies on eza. The update script in `./zshrc.d/arch_update_script.zsh` is specific to Arch Linux (hence the name) and relies on Paru and Reflector.
